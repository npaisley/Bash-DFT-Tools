# Troubleshooting your gaussian calculations  
## "CPHF failed to converge in LinEq2"  
This error can occur when calculating frequencies on a large structure (ex. 100 atoms or more). When calculating DFT frequencies gaussian has two methods. The first stores calculation data in RAM. This makes the calculation much faster and reliable, however, if gaussian runs low on memory or if the system your are calculating frequencies on is large it defaults to a slower method. The slower method stores the calculation data on disk which greatly increses the calculation time (reading from and writing to  disk is significantly slower than the same processes when using RAM). This method is also much less reliable and regularly fails which prints the error above. This can be solved by forcing gaussian to run the calculation using the in-RAM algorithm. Do this by adding `Int=Acc2E=11` to the route section of your .com file. Alternatively `CPHF(MaxInv=10000)` can be used.  
For example: `# freq b3lyp/6-31g* empiricalDispersion=gd3bj Int=Acc2E=11`  
or `# freq b3lyp/6-31g* empiricalDispersion=gd3bj CPHF(MaxInv=10000)`
